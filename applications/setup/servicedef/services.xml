    		SCIPIO: Update accounting preferences for a party (organization). This is a Scipio custom service based on the accounting updatePartyAcctgPreference service 
    		intended for the setup component. The default one doesn't let update almost any of the fields, which from a point of view of a setup application is quite weird.
    		In any case, We should determine with care, what can be updated and in which circumstances.

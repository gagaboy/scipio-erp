    <!-- SCIPIO: NOTE: for multi-project development efficiency and speed, in the Git repositories 
        we leave the repository cache to the default ivy location, which is the user home dir (~/.ivy2/*). 
        If you need a per-project or local repository cache, simply uncomment this line and comment the one below it:
        (FIXME?: repositoryCacheDir as recommended by ivy docs appears to be ignored by ivy 2.4 - unknown reason/bug - so forced to set defaultCacheDir in addition) -->
